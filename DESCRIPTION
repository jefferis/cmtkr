Description: An R package to wrap CMTK (<https://www.nitrc.org/projects/cmtk/>),
    the Computational Morphometry Toolkit. CMTK source code for the subset
    needed for point transforms is vendored in src/cmtk/. This enables direct
    calls to the CMTK library, bypassing command line tools, resulting in order
    of magnitude speedups.
