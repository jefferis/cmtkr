Description: Provides R bindings to selected components of the
    Computational Morphometry Toolkit ('CMTK') for image registration and
    point transformation. A subset of the C++ source code required for point
    transforms is bundled with 'cmtkr'. This allows direct calls into the 'CMTK'
    library, avoiding command-line invocations and providing
    order-of-magnitude speed improvements. Additional 'CMTK' functionality may
    be wrapped in future releases.
