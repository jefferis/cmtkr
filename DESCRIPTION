Description: Wraps 'CMTK' (<https://www.nitrc.org/projects/cmtk/>),
    the Computational Morphometry Toolkit. A subset of the 'CMTK' C++ source
    needed for point transforms is included in src/cmtk/. This enables direct
    library calls, bypassing command line tools, resulting in order of magnitude
    speedups.
