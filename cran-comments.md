## Resubmission

This resubmission addresses the issues raised in the CRAN review email from
Konstanze Lauseker.

### 1) References in `DESCRIPTION`

I added a method reference in the `Description` field using the requested
format:

Rohlfing T and Maurer CR (2003) <doi:10.1109/titb.2003.808506>.

as well as an inst/CITATION file.

### 2) Missing `\\value` documentation

I updated `streamxform` documentation to provide an explicit `\\value` section.

Thank you very much for valuable contributions to the CRAN ecosystem.

With best wishes, 

Greg Jefferis.
